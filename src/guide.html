                                        The best time to visit Antarctica is from late spring to early fall, which in the southern hemisphere is from October to March. The first voyages of the season reach Antarctica in late spring when the sea ice opens up just enough to allow ships into the pristine glacial landscapes. Sailing the Drake Passage from the tip of South America to the Antarctic Peninsula takes 48 hours, while flying to Antarctica takes 2 hours. Approximately 54,000 visitors make the journey each year, with around 50 expedition vessels sailing Antarctic waters each season.2 Taking a ship from Ushuaia is the most popular way to visit Antarctica, while flying from Punta Arenas avoids the infamous Drake Passage and is a great option for people with less time.

                                        Switzerland is a land of stereotypes – expansive greenery, picturesque landscapes, chocolate, cheese, and watches. Switzerland’s lush green vistas are so perfect that they seem to be plucked out of a postcard. It truly is one of the most beautiful places on Earth – soaring Alpine mountains, medieval churches, a bucketful of fresh air, disarming landscapes, and green fields you would endlessly want to run through. It is one of those few places where everything runs on time, the chocolate is fantastic, the countryside is breath-taking and everything is as perfect as a dream!

They comprise 18 volcanic islands, around 80000 sheep, thousands of adorable birds and 50,000 people.Torshavn, the largest capital city in the islands, is one of the cosiest places in the world. The 66.8 sq. mile city is populated by a little over 20,000 people, a couple of museums, a tiny quaint town and rows of houses, very vividly painted to be true. Turf-roofed houses are symbolic of the islands and you will see it everywhere from the capital city to hamlets set at the seaside.

                                        The ‘Land of the Thunder Dragon’ – Bhutan nestles in the mountainous regions of the Eastern Himalayas and is one of the cleanest countries in the South Asian region. A remote kingdom that still clings to its Buddhist culture but embraces modernization, Bhutan is a land of beautiful valleys, snow-clad mountain views, and lush greenery. Bhutan's rich cultural heritage is reflected in its ancient monasteries, intricate temples, and colorful festivals.
