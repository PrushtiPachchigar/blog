                    <h5>1. Use a small backpack/suitcase.</h5>
                    <p>By purchasing a small backpack (I like something around 35/45 liters), you will be forced to pack light and avoid carrying too much stuff. Humans have a natural tendency to want to fill space. Even if you pack light initially but have lots of extra room in your bag, you’ll end up going “well, I guess I can take more” and fill that space. You’ll regret it later as you’ll be carrying around a bunch of stuff you don’t need as well as more weight on your shoulders.</p>
                    <p>The same rule applies to suitcases. Don’t take a huge suitcase because they are a pain in the butt to lug around, especially if you’re traveling long term (short term, not so much). I like Level 8 suitcases. They are durable, quite spacious, nicely designed, and well-priced (luggage can be pretty damn expensive). Plus, they have a TSA lock built into the zipper. </p>
                    <h5>2.	Pack light.</h5>
                    <p>Write down a list of essentials, cut it in half, and then only pack that! Plus, since you bought a small backpack like I said above, you won’t have much room for extra stuff anyways! Take half the clothes you think you will need…you won’t need as much as you think. It’s OK to wear the same t-shirt a few days in a row.
                        I love Unbound Merino, as their travel clothing can be worn daily for weeks without getting smelly. They are super light and they look sylish too. I really love the material, they’re comfortable, they hardly ever need a wash, and they last forever!
                        </p>
                    <h5>3.	Stay in hostels.</h5>
                    <p>They are cheap, organize events, you’ll meet a lot of people, and they are just tons of fun! Plus, hostel bars sell cheap beer. Hostelworld is the best hostel-accommodation site out there, with the largest inventory, best search interface, and highest availability. I use it for all my hostel bookings.</p>
                    <h5>4.	Don’t fly direct.</h5>
                    <p>When booking flights, sometimes it is cheaper to fly in to airports close to your final destination, and then take a train, bus, or budget airline to where you need to go.
                        To use this method, find out how much it is to go directly to your destination. Then, look at prices to nearby airports. If the difference is more than $150 USD, I look to see how much it is to get from the second airport to my primary destination.
                        My favorite flight search engine is Skyscanner. This is my go-to website for finding cheap flights. It searches a lot of different airlines, including many of the budget carriers that larger sites miss.
                        </p>
                    <h5>5.	Always visit the local tourism information center.</h5>
                    <p>This is probably one of the most underused travel tips in the world. Tourism information centers know about everything going on in town. They can point you to free activities, special events happening during your stay, and everything in between. They even offer discounts on attractions and transportation. It is their job to help you experience the destination better. It’s amazing how many travelers skip this when they are visiting somewhere but, as a savvy traveler, you know to use this resource!</p>
                    <h5>6.	Take free walking tours.</h5>
                    <p>Besides being free, these tours will give you a good orientation and background of the city you are visiting. I love, love, love taking walking tours when I travel. You pass the time, you get to pepper the guide with questions, and you get to learn so much about where you are. </p>
                    <p>And while free walking tours are great, sometimes it’s worth it to take a paid walking tour if you’d like to dig deeper into a particular aspect of the destination. Walks is one of my favorite paid walking tour companies, offering in-depth history and cultural tours in cities around the world (especially Europe). Its small-group tours also tend to offer exclusive behind-the-scenes access you can’t get elsewhere.</p>
                    <h5>7.	 Write down your experiences.</h5>
                    <p>Even in this hyper-technological age, I think everyone needs to write more during their travels so they have something to look back on. I never leave home without a journal. Not only do I use them for work (I’m constantly taking notes and writing down ideas) but I also use them to keep track of my travels.
                        Simple travel journals work great for journaling during your trip as well as for writing down logistical information like directions, contact information, and language tips.
                        If you want a travel journal that isn’t just blank pages but rather has space for itinerary planning, places to jot notes in the local language, inspirational quotes, and more, grab our new travel journal. It was designed specifically with travelers in mind, so you can take notes as well as write down stories and reflections during your travels.
                        </p>
                    <h5>8.	Lunchtime is the best time to visit historical sites.</h5>
                    <p>Be a contrarian. You’ll have fewer crowds getting in your way as big tour buses, groups, and most travelers head to lunch. It’s always best to visit an attraction super early, late, or when people eat. You’ll have even the most popular places to yourself!</p>
                    <h5>9.	Carry a basic first-aid kit.</h5>
                    <p>Accidents happen, so be prepared. I always take band-aids, antibacterial cream, and ointments for minor cuts and scrapes. You never know when you’re going to need it and you can’t always get it when you travel.
                        You can either assemble a first aid kit yourself
                    </p>
                    <h5>10.	Don’t believe the cheap flight myths.</h5>
                    <p>Don’t drive yourself too crazy trying to get the absolute cheapest fare. There are a lot of myths online about how to find cheap flights, but there is no magic bullet or one secret ninja trick. It’s not cheaper to book on a particular day of the week, or if you search in an incognito window.
                        Spending five hours to try to save $10 will cause you a lot of stress. Once you find a flight deal that you’re happy with, book right away, as airfares change by the minute. Remember, you usually have a 24-hour window to cancel in case you need to.
                        </p>
                    <h5>Finally, wear sunscreen.</h5>
                    <p>For as the Baz Luhrmann song “Everybody’s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)” goes:
                        If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.
                        The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
                        Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
                        Than my own meandering experience.</p>
